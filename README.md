The best way to memorize foreign words.

I learned Flutter and darts in a week and wrote this app in a short time.This is my first app with
Flutter, it was generally made for learning purposes.Therefore the application code is complex and 
difficult to understand.But you can still download the application from Google play, I hope it will 
help people who learn new languages.
